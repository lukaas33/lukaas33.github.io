# My websites

![A banner image for this repository](https://image.ibb.co/jYh1Sw/cover_web.jpg)

In this repository I keep the websites that I make. It's kind of a mess, I'm figuring this out as I go along.   
Smaller websites are kept in the webpages folder.

It's published to a webhost and it serves as my resume and portfolio.
My websites are in English but some documentation be in Dutch.
Descriptions of projects are stored in the data-folder and can be viewed at the projects/{name} path.

I currently only make websites for learning or for fun.
All my code is open source, so if I ever make something nice everyone can use it.

In my other [repository](https://github.com/lukaas33/general-server) I only do server-side programming. With this one the server-side is only for the portfolio project.
