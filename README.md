# My websites

## Intro

In this repository I keep the websites that I make.  
It's published to a webhost which serves as my resume and portfolio.
My websites are in English but some documentation in the portfolio may be Dutch.

I currently only make websites for learning or for fun.
All my code is open source, so if I ever make something nice everyone can use it.

## News

I'm trying to switch to Node.js and to host this website at Heroku.
The old _(working)_ PHP website can still be found [here](lukaas33.esy.es).

I've learned some Python and am not sure what I can do with it.

I ordered a Raspberry Pi.
