# My websites

## Intro

In this repository I keep the websites that I make.
Smaller websites are kept in the webpages folder while descriptions are generated at the projects folder.
It's published to a webhost and it serves as my resume and portfolio.
My websites are in English but some documentation in the portfolio may be Dutch.

I currently only make websites for learning or for fun.
All my code is open source, so if I ever make something nice everyone can use it.

## News

My website now works with Node.

I've learned some Python and am not sure what I can do with it.
